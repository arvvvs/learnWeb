    <h1> The Story in the Book </h1>
    <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
       an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
       of <i> New Scientist</i>, <i>Nature</i>, and all
       the other scientific journals her work had appeared in
       was a well thmbed copy of <cite> On The Road </cite>.It
       had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer
       she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to 
       be free </p>
    <p>She spent the last ten years in this room sitting under a poster with
       an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q> Work is the refuge of
       people who have nothing better to do </q>.  Although many consider
       her pinoeering work, unraveling the secrets of teh llama 
        <abbr title ="Deoxyribonucleic acide"> DNA </abbr>, to be an 
        outstanding achievement Molly <em> did</em> think she had soemthing
        better to do. </p>
